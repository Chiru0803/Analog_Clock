# Analog_Clock

An Analog Clock is a graphical representation of a traditional clock with hour, minute, and second hands.
It displays the current time in a visual format using the positions of these hands on a circular dial.

The Analog Clock can be implemented using the Tkinter library in Python, which provides a simple way to create graphical user interfaces.
Tkinter allows us to draw the clock face, hands, and update their positions based on the current time.

Clock Face: The circular dial representing the clock's face, divided into 12 hours.
Hour Hand: A line or pointer indicating the current hour.
Minute Hand: A line or pointer indicating the current minute.
Second Hand: A line or pointer indicating the current second.
